## Defi project using dapp university's dBank tutorial

### Technologies used

- React with Typescript
- Ethers.js for connecting with Smart Contract
- Typechain to generate types for the contract
- Context API and useReducer for state management
- TailwindCSS for styling

### How to run the project
- Install and run Ganache
- Install metamask and create a new network for Ganache
- Install all the dependencies ``npm install``


(P.S): I didn't write the contract myself. Original credit goes to [DappUniversity's DBank tutorial](https://github.com/dappuniversity/dbank).
I've changed all the technologies he used and rewritten the frontend myself.
Pardon me for the ugly UI. I'll try my best to make the UI look better in the future.
